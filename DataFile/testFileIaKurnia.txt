Halo My Name Ia Kurnia.
The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys). As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared with anyone.

The RSA algorithm is named after those who invented it in 1978: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.

How it works
The RSA algorithm ensures that the keys, in the above illustration, are as secure as possible. The following steps highlight how it works:

1. Generating the keys
2. Encryption
3. Decryption
